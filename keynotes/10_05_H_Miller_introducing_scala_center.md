- Functional program design in scala
- NEW! Parallel programming
- NEW! Big data in analysis with scala and spark

### Functional programming principles in scala

- start here, all the basic stuff for functional programming

### Functional program design in scala

- more advanced FP concepts


### NEW! Parallel programming

- basic of parallel computing
- basic task parallelism

### NEW! Big data in analysis with scala and spark

 - Take parallel processing to distributed and what differs

## When will it start?

- Course 1-3: May 23rd (planned)

# Open Source

## Much can be improved
