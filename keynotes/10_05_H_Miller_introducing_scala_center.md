- Evolve the community
- Education

## Mission statement

> Independently guide and support the Scala community

> Coordinate and develop open source libraries and tools for the benefit of all
> Scala users

> Provide deep, and quality, educational materials for Scala

# Education

## Moocs on coursera

- Scala has the highest completion rate MOOCS on the coursera.
- 400k people signed up
- Unfortunately it went down

## New courses on the new coursera platform

- Now can go through course on demand
- you can get a verified degree
- Automated grading!

## Courses

- Functional programming principles in scala
- Functional program design in scala
- NEW! Parallel programming
- NEW! Big data in analysis with scala and spark

### Functional programming principles in scala

- start here, all the basic stuff for functional programming

### Functional program design in scala

- more advanced FP concepts


### NEW! Parallel programming

- basic of parallel computing
- basic task parallelism

### NEW! Big data in analysis with scala and spark

 - Take parallel processing to distributed and what differs

## When will it start?

- Course 1-3: May 23rd (planned)

# Open Source

## Much can be improved

- Improve Libraries
- Provide structure and infrastructure

## Philosophy

- Grow contributor community
- Provide hardware and infrastructure
- Projects a re managed, larger goals a re broken into pieces
- at least 1-2 scala center staff members are engaged and participating thought
  development

## We want

> Maximize benefit for the entire community. Work together

## How are we going to do it?

- Weekly 30 min project meetings
- Dedicated slack channels
- Project management and contributions

## How does it work?

- Donations from industrial partners
- Revenue from the MOOCs
- Advisory board: Discuss areas of concern that might need attention
  - SC reps
  - Community reps (voting)
  - Corporate reps (voting)

## What about Lightbend

- Work together!
- They still continue to maintain scala compiler

# First projects

## Package index or something like that.

- Map of the known scala ecosystem
- based on the published libraries,
- Info from maven, nitray, GitHub, StackOverflow & more
- Status: crawled maven and collected all + connected to Github
- Next: Put some nice UI

## Demo
